# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive with Dynamic Class Names

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with dynamically generated class names.  The problem arises when the dynamic class name doesn't resolve correctly, leading to unexpected styling or no styling at all.

## Problem Description:
The `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS is a powerful tool for reusing styles, but it can exhibit unexpected behavior when dealing with dynamically generated or conditional classes.  This often occurs if there is an issue with how the class name string is constructed or if the class does not exist in your Tailwind configuration.
